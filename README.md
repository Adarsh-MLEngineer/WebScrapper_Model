# WebScraper-ML

A Machine Learning-based Web Scraper tool that extracts, analyzes, and visualizes website content through an interactive GUI.

## Overview

The **WebScraper-ML** project allows users to input a website URL and automatically extract valuable information from it. The tool leverages **Python**, robust web scraping techniques, and **basic machine learning** to provide insights into website content and structure.

-----

## Key Features

  * **Metadata Extraction:** Automatically retrieves crucial website metadata such as **title**, **description**, **keywords**, and author information.
  * **Client-Side Code Scraping:** Extracts **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** components to understand the frontend structure.
  * **Content Analysis:** Uses **basic NLP** and **ML techniques** (like keyword extraction) to analyze the website content for patterns, core topics, or sentiment.
      * Generates insights about the structure, topics, or focus areas of the website.
  * **Interactive GUI:** Built using **Tkinter** for an easy-to-use interface.
      * Users can input URLs, view results, and visualize extracted data without touching the code.

-----

## Detailed Features

  * User-friendly **GUI interface** for easy interaction.
  * Automatic extraction of **metadata** and **client-side code**.
  * Content analysis with **keyword extraction** and basic machine learning insights.
  * **Visual representation** of results via graphs or charts.
  * **Modular design** for easy expansion or integration with other tools.
